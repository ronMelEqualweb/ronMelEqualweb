- ⚡ Fun fact:
  Komodo dragons are the largest living lizards in the world and can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long!
   Despite their size, they are fast and can run up to 13 mph (20 km/h) in short bursts.
    Komodo dragons also have a powerful bite with venom that prevents blood clotting, making their prey easier to subdue after an attack.
